# Static Preview

Many websites are available on Github, but remain unhosted by their creators. Static Preview allows users to input a link to any Github, BitBucket, and GitLab repository containing an `index.html` file. All necessary files are requested directly from the user's client to the host and rendered locally.

In other words, Static Preview is a tool to "host" websites locally.

A hosted version application is available at https://static-preview.vercel.app.
